The power of habits is beyond imagination.

This book provides a systematic framework to help readers build good habits and break bad ones. The author emphasizes that improving by 1% every day means you'll be 37 times better by the end of the year.

Key takeaways:

1. **Make it obvious**: Make habits visible
2. **Make it attractive**: Make habits appealing
3. **Make it easy**: Make habits easy to execute
4. **Make it satisfying**: Make habits fulfilling

I particularly liked the book's perspective on "identity": don't say "I'm trying to quit smoking," say "I don't smoke." Behavior change stems from identity change.

This book not only has theory but also many practical techniques. For example, "habit stacking"—attaching new habits after old ones, and the "two-minute rule"—starting a new habit shouldn't take more than two minutes.

After reading this book, I started getting up early to read every day and have stuck with it for a month. Recommended to anyone who wants to change themselves.
