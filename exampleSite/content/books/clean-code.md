This is a classic that every programmer should read.

The book details how to write clear, maintainable code. Through numerous examples, the author demonstrates best practices from naming to function design, from error handling to code organization.

Core concepts include:

- **Meaningful names**: Variable, function, and class names should reveal their intent
- **Functions**: Functions should be short and sweet, doing only one thing
- **Comments**: Good code doesn't need comments; comments are often a sign that code isn't expressive enough
- **Error Handling**: Error handling should be separated from business logic
- **Unit Tests**: Tests are an important guarantee of code maintainability

This book made me re-examine my coding style. Whenever I write long, complex functions, I think back to Clean Code's teachings.

Highly recommended for all developers who care about code quality.
