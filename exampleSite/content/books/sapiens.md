A grand history of human development.

From the Cognitive Revolution to the Agricultural Revolution, to the Scientific Revolution, the author re-examines the course of human history with a unique perspective.

What impressed me most was the view that humans dominate the earth because we can imagine and believe in shared stories. Money, nations, laws, corporations—these are all imaginary constructs we collectively believe in.

The book's discussion of "happiness" was also enlightening. The author points out that with the development of biotechnology, we may ultimately ask ourselves: what do we really want? More happiness, or more meaning?

This book gave me new thoughts about humanity's past and future. It's not just a history book, but a philosophical meditation.

Some views may be radical, but they certainly provoke deep thinking. Recommended for readers interested in history and humanity's destiny.
