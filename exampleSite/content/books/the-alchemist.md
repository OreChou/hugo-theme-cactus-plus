This is a novel about pursuing dreams, telling the fantastical adventure of Santiago, a Spanish shepherd boy.

The core idea that runs through the book is: "When you truly desire something, the entire universe conspires to help you achieve it."

This book is simple yet profound. Through a simple fable, it explores the meaning of life, dreams, and destiny. It tells us to bravely follow our hearts and not be bound by fear and comfort.

I particularly liked the concept of "Personal Legend"—everyone comes into this world with their own mission, and the important thing is to listen to your inner voice and bravely pursue it.

This book is perfect for reading when you're feeling lost; it will give you the courage to start again.
